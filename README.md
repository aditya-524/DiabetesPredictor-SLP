<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a repository for implementing, describing, and testing a Single Layer Perceptron for predicting diabetes. The results are in form of a short conference paper.
I achieved an accuracy of 80.58%. In the project i used 5 fold cross validation with shuffling for determining the ideal learning rate. I used the [PIMA Indians dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
.The training was evaluated using evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Execution and AUC on various learning rates. For a detailed analysis of the results, please refer to [paper]() & [code](). Below are some of the results from the paper.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview
We use a very basic implementation of SLP([Single Layer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)) in classifying if the patient
is diabetic or not.

<!-- REIMPLEMENTATION -->
## Implementing
The project is implemented using a jupyter notebook, so its fairly straightforward to download it directly to retest. [Notebook]()

<!-- Dependencies -->
## Dependencies
The code utilizes the python packages as such 
* matplotlib, 
* seaborn, 
* pandas, 
* numpy, 
* scikit-learn,
* Tensorflow.
